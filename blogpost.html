        <p class="font1">In the age of the internet, organizations are heavily relying on IT infrastructure to keep them
            safe from cyberattacks. As more and more organizations are adopting digital transformation, the risk of
            cybercrime is increasing at a rapid rate; so is the importance of cybersecurity.

            Cybersecurity has become the knight in shining armour. Strong cybersecurity policy and infrastructure work
            together to secure computer systems and networks from an unauthorized attack or access. Businesses,
            individuals, and governments are investing heavily to reap the benefits of cybersecurity in protecting their
            assets and data against hackers. For any business to survive in todays competitive world, it requires the
            right tools and cyber security strategy.</p>
        <p class="font1">Cyber security is the practice of securing computer systems and networks against unauthorized
            access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible by mitigating information risks and vulnerabilities.
            Information risks include unauthorized access, interception, use, disclosure, or data destruction. The
            purpose of Cybersecurity serves as a shield to safeguard devices and services from malicious attacks
            orchestrated by hackers, spammers, and cybercriminals. Organizations employ this crucial practice to shield
            themselves against various threats, including phishing schemes, ransomware attacks, identity theft, data
            breaches, and potential financial losses.</p>
        <p class="font1">The aim of a cyber attack is to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Hackers employ
            various techniques to infiltrate systems, seeking to either destroy or manipulate critical data. The motive
            behind such intrusions can range from causing chaos to exploit a vulnerability for strategic gain.


            Sometimes, cybercriminals may resort to extortion tactics by illegally obtaining sensitive information and
            threatening the victim. These threats could range from information exposure to data manipulation with a
            ransom in exchange. This attack places organizations in a precarious position, emphasizing the need for
            robust cybersecurity measures to prevent such coercive actions.

           </p>
        <p class="font1">Hackers target trade secrets and valuable information like intellectual property. They aim to
            inflict significant damage on a competitors business by stealing and exposing these proprietary assets.
            Releasing trade secrets can lead to losing a competitive edge, affecting profitability and market standing.
            Some cyber attacks focus on disrupting an organizations regular operations. This could involve tactics like
            Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which aim to overwhelm systems and networks. The objective is
            to create chaos, impede business activities, and potentially cause financial losses. Cybersecurity measures
            are essential to mitigate such disruptive threats. Cybersecurity is important because it protects
            organizational assets and services from malicious attacks and safeguards all types of data, including but
            not limited to sensitive data, protected health information (PHI), and personally identifiable information
            (PII) from theft and loss.

            Obtaining a cybersecurity certification can help you protect yourself against fraud and online assaults!</p>
